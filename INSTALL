This program is written in the D language.

To build, you need a D compiler (DMD, gdc and ldc2 have been verified to work)
and the DUB package manager which comes with the DMD compiler.

To build, simply run

dub build -b=release --compiler=ldc2

(You can replace ldc2 with gdc or dmd if you wish).

The binary is placed within the 'bin' directory in the sanspam directory.
